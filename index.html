  <p>Dear ECO225 Regrade Team,</p>

  <p>Thank you for taking the time to consider my regrade request. I have ordered my points chronologically (as they appear in my feedback).</p>

  <h2>Issue #1 - 'The Main Message' Sentences Component</h2>
  <p>I got 0/5 for the Main Message (not the plot) even though I provided precisely what the P2 guideline asked for; "one or two sentences" (a short format articulation of the main message of my paper). I deemed it logical that I would present the main message plot first, since this would allow the reader to create their own understanding of my paper based on a visualisation – this was in line with what we covered in lecture with Professor Khazra; being able to convey a message with a well-designed plot. Perhaps the fact that I included before as opposed to after the worded "1-2 sentences" confused the grader, who asserted that I did not include a message at all <em>("No message?")</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Note: the guideline did not ask for an interpretation of the main message plot, so I thought that it would be self-explanatory that the worded "message" would come in the form of the interpretation of my plot – this makes logical sense, right? If the main message is conveyed in both the plot and two sentences, then the sentences are essentially an interpretation of the plot! That is why I titled section (2.1.2) "1-2 Sentence Description/Interpretation".</em></p>

  <p>I did obey the guideline's structure, by titling the overall main message part of my project as "2.1. The Message". But I subdivided it into "(2.1.1) The Plot" and "(2.1.2) 1-2 Sentences...".</p>
  <p>I submit that I should not be penalized for a choice I made about structuring my project, since I obey the default structure guideline.</p>

  <h2>Issue #2 - 'The Main Message' Plot Component</h2>
  <p>Directly because of the misunderstanding I described above <em>("Since I don't understand what your main message is, it's hard to grade this message plot")</em>. I got penalized for the message plot. The grader also suggests an alternate plot that would not have worked for my study, because—as I make clear various times throughout the project(s)—my research paper involved a key distinction between urban and rural neighborhoods. This is mentioned directly in my research question. Additionally, considering that I am working with panel data (hence multiple units of observation; 450 counties); I had to create a plot that would account for a general trend in variables; I thus created a line plot that contains 4 pieces of information:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The evolution of fertility rate</li>
    <li>The evolution of house prices</li>
    <li>The visual understanding of how the above change over time (x axis is time)</li>
    <li>A division of the above two variables into rural and urban counties</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Thereby the essence of my research question is captured in my main message plot.</p>

  <h2>Issue #3 - Maps</h2>
  <h3>a) Maps (20/25)</h3>
  <p>I believe that I was marked particularly harshly in this section. Firstly, the lack of comments about my first two maps but the presence of a negative comment on my third map implies that I got penalized 20% for including the third. This is all despite the fact that I exceeded the baseline expectation for maps, by plotting a third, distinct map – distinct because as opposed to focusing on all of the United States for the third time, I localized my focus on one state – this necessitated completely different code, etc. The simple point here is that my third plot is extremely relevant because it expands on the first map. It:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Zooms in on California, an exemplary state, allowing the viewer to scrutinize subtleties and patterns in fertility rates across counties that are not visible in the zoomed-out, holistic USA plot.</li>
    <li>Includes the point-plots of the largest metropolitan areas in California. This, again, required completely different code than the first two plots; Professor Khazra had a whole dedicated section of the Mapping lecture devoted to point plots.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>b) Map Explanations (7/10)</h3>
  <p>The feedback mentions <em>"your maps are done by county (not urban-rural) so I don't see how you can make a comment on it"</em>. The fact that my maps are done by county <em>is precisely</em> what allows for the interpretation of rural versus urban – there is no more precise method of aggregating data in plots than counties, especially when plotting the country or state altogether. The third (California) plot in fact is purposed precisely to counter the point of this feedback, through its inclusion of main metropolitan area point plots.</p>

  <h2>Issue #4 – OLS Regressions</h2>
  <p>The feedback states: <em>“You’ve addressed the necessary elements, but I’m confused because you focused before on urban-rural but that didn’t show up as a variable in your regressions?”</em> This is a direct contradiction to what is present in regressions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 (all but my first regressions include a variable representing urbanization). In fact, the interpretations of my regressions (where I mention how urbanization is represented in my regressions) received a tick mark from the grader. In (2.3.2.ii), under the interpretation of Figure 14, for instance I say:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“In this specification, counties are classified into two groups - those that are in the top 30% of population density (urban), and those in the bottom 30% (rural; baseline). The interaction term between ZHVI and this top-30% dummy shows whether the effect of housing costs on fertility differs in denser areas relative to less-dense ones. The estimated interaction coefficient indicates how much more (or less) strongly house prices predict fertility in counties above that 30% density threshold.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The fact that the grader provided feedback that my regressions <em>“did not include a urban-rural variable”</em> makes it seem like they have not read my interpretation at all. I also get semi-accused of cheating in the regression comment, which was quite hurtful considering that I have put in two semesters of work into this course so far. It is obvious that if I cheated then Crowdmark’s plagiarism/AI detection tool would report this to you.</p>

  <p>I know that this regrade request is lengthy and I thank you very much again for providing the regrade opportunity. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me with any questions or clarifications. I entirely stand behind my points in this first regrade request and I am optimistic about your understanding.</p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br>
  Filip Zaleski</p>
